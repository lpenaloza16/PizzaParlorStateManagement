## About This Project

In this project, we use the example of running a pizza parlor to learn about keeping track of things in a web application, like orders and deliveries, in a simple way.

### What We're Showing

- **Keeping Track of Things:** We show how a website can remember what's happening, like what pizzas you've ordered, in a way that's easy to handle.
- **Making Changes Happen:** We use simple tools to show how your actions (like ordering a pizza) change what the website remembers (your order list).

### Why We Made This

The main idea was to make a tricky topic easy to understand by using something familiar, like ordering pizza. This way, learning feels more like fun and less like work.

### What This Means for You

By looking at this project, you'll see how websites handle information and changes in a smart way. It's not just about pizza; it's about making websites work better and smarter.
